                                                    Interview Questions and Answers
1) What is phishing?

Phishing is a social engineering attack where an attacker impersonates a trusted entity to trick users into revealing sensitive information like credentials, credit card details, or OTPs. 
It is commonly delivered through email but can also occur via SMS or phone calls.

2) How do you identify a phishing email?

Check for suspicious sender addresses, mismatched URLs, urgent or threatening language, generic greetings, unexpected attachments, and spelling errors. 
Also hover over links to verify the actual destination before clicking.

3) What is email spoofing?

Email spoofing is when an attacker forges the sender’s email address to make it appear as if the email came from a legitimate source. It is commonly used in phishing attacks to gain the victim’s trust.

4) Why are phishing emails dangerous?

Phishing emails can lead to credential theft, financial fraud, malware infections, and data breaches. 
They are one of the most common initial attack vectors in cyber incidents.

5) How can you verify the sender’s authenticity?

I verify the full email address, check the domain spelling, review SPF, DKIM, and DMARC results in the email header, and confirm through official communication channels if necessary.

6) What tools can analyze email headers?

Tools like Google Message Header Analyzer, MXToolbox, email client header viewers, Wireshark, and SIEM solutions like Splunk can be used to analyze email headers and trace the sending path.

7) What actions should be taken for suspected phishing emails?

Do not click links or download attachments. 
Report the email to the SOC or IT team. 
In a SOC role, analyze headers, check domain/IP reputation, sandbox attachments, block malicious sources, and reset compromised accounts if needed.

8) How do attackers use social engineering in phishing?

Attackers exploit human psychology using urgency, fear, authority, curiosity, or greed to manipulate victims into taking actions like clicking malicious links or sharing sensitive information.
